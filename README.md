Gaussian Blur (Linear Sampling / Offset Packing)

This project implements an optimized Gaussian blur using the
linear sampling (offset packing) technique described in:

Efficient Gaussian Blur with Linear Sampling – Rastergrid

The goal is to reduce texture fetch count while preserving physically correct Gaussian blur.
